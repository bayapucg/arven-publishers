					<p >With the advancement of scientific publishing, plagiarism and duplicate submission have become one of the growing issues in publishing society. The sole purpose of Arven Periodicals is to publish and distribute unique content, which helps in advancing the research. With increasing online resources, malpractices also increasing. The articles submitted will be strictly evaluated prior to the publication process. If we identify plagiarism, the article will be sent back to the author for rewritten or if we found duplicate submission, a direct rejection of the article will take place. If content duplication is identified during or completion of the process either by the journal team or editor or reviewer, necessary action will be taken immediately. We request the authors not to fabricate or falsify the content or citation and submit the article with unique content. In case of figures, tables, and supplementary files, the authors are requested to cite the source material.
