						<li>Submitted manuscripts should be of their original work or of the work, they are associated with during their tenure. Submitted manuscripts should contain original and authentic results, data and their ideas, which are not published elsewhere.</li>
						<li>Authors should not submit the same manuscript, in the same language simultaneously to more than one journal. The rationale for this standard is the potential for disagreement when two (or more) journals claim the right to publish a manuscript that has been submitted simultaneously to more than one journal, and the possibility that two or more journals will unknowingly and unnecessarily undertake the work of peer review, edit the same manuscript, and publish the same article.</li>
						<li>Preparing of data and results, intellectual property theft and plagiarism are highly unacceptable, it is beyond the ethics of an author. Information obtained from various media can be provided in the manuscript only with prior permission from the owner of the source of information or data. </li>
						<li>Authors should properly cite the work they are referring; authors are advised to cross check the reference before submission of manuscript that it has all the contents that a manuscript should have.</li>
						<li>Authors and co-authors are requested to review and ensure the accuracy and validity of all the results prior to submission. Any potential conflict of interest should be informed to the editor in advance. </li>
						<li>All authors are requested to submit the copyright transfer form without failure once they receive the acceptance of their article for publication.</li>
						<li>When human experimentation is being reported, a statement must be included confirming that the work was done in accordance with the appropriate institutional review body and carried out with the ethical standards.</li>
						<li>Manuscript should include a signed statement of informed consent to publish (in online) patient descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees from all persons (parents or legal guardians for minors) who can be identified in such written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees. Such persons should be shown the manuscript before its submission.</li>
						<li>Sharing with public media, government agencies, or manufacturers the scientific information described in a paper or a letter to the editor that has been accepted but not yet published violates the policies of many journals</li>

					<h3 class="">   Plagiarism Policy 
					</h3>
					<div class="lis-sty-none">
						<p>Plagiarism is an act of using thoughts of another author without authorization and the representation of that author's work as one's own, without crediting the original author. Whether intentional or unintentional, plagiarism is recognized as a serious academic offence. All manuscripts received towards GRF journals are scanned for plagiarism. If potential plagiarism is detected, authors will be contacted for clarification. The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others, it is necessary to indicate the source of the information within your paper using an internal citation. Failing to properly quote, cite or acknowledge someone else's words or ideas with an internal citation is plagiarism. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behaviour and is unacceptable.</p>
